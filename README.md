# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Hi there! I'm a data analyst with a passion for uncovering insights from complex datasets and building end-to-end data projects. This portfolio showcases my skills in data curation, geospatial analysis, business intelligence, comparative machine learning, time-series forecasting, and model deployment.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Global Water Risk Assessment for Energy Infrastructure
*A comprehensive exploratory analysis and interactive dashboard visualizing the baseline and future water stress exposure of ~35,000 power plants worldwide. This project identifies geographic and technological hotspots for the critical water-energy nexus.*
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data Visualization, Looker Studio, Dashboard Design, Geospatial Analysis (GeoPandas), Data Curation.
* **[View the Interactive Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/db75b288-9c6b-4b15-8dd8-f35e03fd3b10)**

### 2. Solar Power Forecasting & Live App Deployment
*An end-to-end regression and time-series project to predict solar power output from weather data. The analysis compares a baseline XGBoost model against deep learning architectures, culminating in an advanced LSTM forecasting model. The best regression model was then deployed as a live, interactive web application using Streamlit.*
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Time-Series Forecasting, LSTM, Regression (XGBoost), Model Deployment, Streamlit, Feature Engineering.

### 3. Stellar Classification with Machine Learning
*A comparative modeling project to classify celestial objects (Stars, Galaxies, Quasars) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This project establishes a strong Random Forest baseline and compares its performance against multiple advanced neural network techniques, including class weighting and ensemble methods.*
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Machine Learning, Classification, Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras), Ensemble Modeling, Scikit-learn, Feature Importance.
