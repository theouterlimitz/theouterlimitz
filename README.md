## Featured Projects

### 1. Global Water Risk Assessment for Energy Infrastructure
*A comprehensive exploratory analysis and interactive dashboard visualizing the baseline and future water stress exposure of ~35,000 power plants worldwide.*
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Data Visualization, Looker Studio, Dashboard Design, Geospatial Analysis, Data Curation.
* **[View the Interactive Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/db75b288-9c6b-4b15-8dd8-f35e03fd3b10)**
* **[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/theouterlimitz/global-power-plant-database)**

### 2. Stellar Classification with Machine Learning
*A comparative modeling project to classify celestial objects (Stars, Galaxies, Quasars) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This project compares a Random Forest baseline against several Neural Network architectures to determine the most effective model.*
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Machine Learning, Classification, Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras), Model Evaluation, Feature Importance, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
* **[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/theouterlimitz/SDSS_Star_Classification)**

### 3.  Meta-Analysis: Systemic Water Risk in the Global Solar Fleet
*A combined analysis linking the findings from the previous two projects to investigate a novel question: Are solar power plants, a key green energy source, disproportionately located in high water-stress regions?*
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Hypothesis Testing, Connecting Disparate Datasets, Advanced EDA, Critical Thinking.
* **[View the Analysis Notebook](https://github.com/theouterlimitz/global-power-plant-database/blob/master/01_Global_Solar_Risk_Analysis.ipynb)**
